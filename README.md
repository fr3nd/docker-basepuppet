# docker-basepuppet

## Description

Base image based on debian:jessie with Puppet, Facter and r10k installed.

Puppet instead of plain shell script.

## How to use this image

```
FROM fr3nd/basepuppet
MAINTAINER Carles Amig√≥, fr3nd@fr3nd.net

ADD Puppetfile /etc/puppet/Puppetfile
WORKDIR /etc/puppet
RUN r10k puppetfile install

RUN puppet apply -e "include apache"

EXPOSE 80
